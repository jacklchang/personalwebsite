                <p>This project matters because currently Docs is geared towards experienced IT professionals and are
                    not user-friendly to university students. Microsoft wants to ensure university students are able to
                    navigate the Docs platform and use it successfully. Our sponsors want to create brand loyalty for
                    the use of their programs.
                </p>
                <p>Information problem: The Docs platform has been developed to a high level of functionality, but is
                    currently only usable by senior developers and IT professionals with years of experience. Students
                    require access to information customized to their experience levels in order to understand how to
                    use this platform.
                </p>
                <p>Problem statement: How might Microsoft tailor the Microsoft Docs platform
                    so they can engage with university students in the US?

                <span>Our final deliverable: </span>
                <a href="microsoftencounter.com">Microsoft Encounter</a>
                <p>Abstract: Microsoft Learn was designed to be a student-facing platform to help develop technical
                    skills but the experience was targeted towards professionals. Our team collaborated with university
                    students to re-architect the site and build a platform that was more enticing to their skill level.
                    By customizing the platform to better fit their needs, our solution, Microsoft Encounter, alleviates
                    the major pain points of the Learn platform and delivers all the key features students look for in a
                    technical learning site. In turn, this will lead to brand loyalty and turn the students of today
                    into their customers of tomorrow.
