                <p><u>My 5 core values</u></p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Reflection </li>
                    <p>​This value means to me a look upon my actions in the past and evaluate as to whether they were
                        positively impactful or negatively impactful. This gives me an opportunity to learn as to what I
                        can improve upon for the next situation, or praise myself on a good deed and take the time to
                        appreciate myself. This value is the most important one to me because my goal is to constantly
                        strive to be a good person and to reflect on myself is critical to achieving this goal.
                    </p>
                    <li> Authenticity </li>
                    <p>​This value means to present myself in a way that is true. I find that being true to myself and
                        being unafraid to express that is a great privilege. I hope to inspire a safe environment that
                        allows others to be true to themselves as well. This value is extremely important to me because
                        I find that by being authentic, I can make deeper connections with others.
                    </p>
                    <li> Connection </li>
                    <p>This value means to agree with someone on values, interests and more. I have been very lucky to
                        meet some people I have a deep connection with and the bond created from it is so special. I
                        hope to create an environment as a leader to which everyone can connect with each other in some
                        way and this promotes a healthy work environment. For example, I would be willing to go the
                        extra mile for someone I have a connection with - whether that is staying up late at night to
                        help them with their assignments or always picking up their phone calls. I find genuine and pure
                        connections are what makes a team cohesive and leads to better results.
                    </p>
                    <li> Perceptiveness </li>
                    <p>This value means to be aware of my surroundings and other people’s behaviour. I find this value
                        important because there have been situations in which someone has been offended by a comment
                        made and being attentive to their body language allows there to be an opportunity to learn,
                        apologize and overcome the situation. I highly value being perceptive, because I hope to always
                        take note on someone’s state of mind and if it is negative I would always want to do my best to
                        turn it around.
                    </p>
                    <li> Efficiency </li>
                    <p>​This value means performing tasks at the highest quality in the shortest amount of time. I find
                        this value important to me because I do not like to take the long way around things. For
                        example, I organize my grocery list based on the location of the items in the store so I do not
                        need to go back and forth between aisles. I find that this saves me time and I highly enjoy
                        being efficient.
                    </p>
